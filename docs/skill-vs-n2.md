# 📏 `.md` Skills vs `.n2` Contracts

> **Why replace markdown-based skills with compiled `.n2` contracts?**

Every AI coding tool uses markdown files to define agent behavior — `GEMINI.md`, `.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, skill files in `workflows/*.md`. They all share the same fatal flaw: **zero enforcement**.

This document compares the traditional markdown skill approach with Clotho's compiled `.n2` contracts.

---

## The Core Problem

```
📝 .md Skill:  "Please follow these 9 coding pillars"
   → AI: "Got it!" → uses `any` 47 times, skips verification, deploys untested code

📜 .n2 Contract:  @rule TypeSafety { checks: [no_any_type] }
   → AI attempts `any` → ❌ BLOCKED before it reaches your codebase
```

**Markdown is a suggestion. `.n2` is compiled law.**

---

## Side-by-Side Comparison

### 1. Workflow Enforcement

#### `.md` Skill (hope-based)

```markdown
## Mandatory Workflow
1. Boot → n2_boot()
2. Pre-code → Call n2_coding()
3. Code → Write production-grade code
4. Post-code → Call n2_coding_verify()
5. End → n2_work_end()
```

> AI reads this, then skips step 2 and 4. Nothing happens.

#### `.n2` Contract (compiler-enforced)

```n2
@contract CodingLifecycle {
  scope: session
  states: CodingState

  transitions {
    COLD -> BOOTED : on n2_boot
    BOOTED -> SKILLED : on n2_coding
    SKILLED -> WORKING : on n2_work_start
    WORKING -> VERIFYING : on n2_coding_verify
    VERIFYING -> DONE : on n2_work_end
  }

  invariant {
    on n2_work_start requires state == SKILLED
    => "n2_coding must be loaded before starting work"

    on n2_work_end requires state == VERIFYING
    => "Cannot end work without running n2_coding_verify"
  }
}
```

> AI tries to skip `n2_coding` → **❌ BLOCKED**. State machine won't transition.

---

### 2. Coding Standards

#### `.md` Skill

```markdown
## 9 Pillars (Summary)
| # | Pillar | Key Rule |
| 1 | Type Safety | ZERO `as any`, explicit return types |
| 2 | Complexity | Function < 50 lines, CC < 10, file < 500 lines |
| 6 | Conventions | ESLint strict, naming rules |
```

> AI "agrees" then writes 800-line files with `as any` everywhere.

#### `.n2` Contract

```n2
@rule TypeSafety {
  description: "Zero tolerance for type violations"
  scope: code
  enforce: strict

  checks: [
    no_any_type,
    no_ts_ignore,
    no_ts_expect_error,
    explicit_return_types
  ]
}

@rule Complexity {
  description: "Keep code simple and readable"
  scope: code
  enforce: strict

  checks: [
    max_file_lines: 500,
    max_function_lines: 50,
    cyclomatic_complexity: 10
  ]
}

@rule NamingConventions {
  scope: code
  enforce: strict

  checks: [
    components: /^[A-Z][a-zA-Z]+$/,
    variables: /^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$/,
    constants: /^[A-Z_]+$/
  ]
}
```

> Each rule is individually checkable, queryable, and enforced.

---

### 3. Post-Coding Verification

#### `.md` Skill

```markdown
## Post-Coding Checklist
- [ ] All test/scratch/temp files deleted
- [ ] No legacy code left
- [ ] No unused imports
- [ ] No console.log debug statements
- [ ] ZERO `as any`
- [ ] Every function < 50 lines
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` = 0 errors
- [ ] Would you be proud to deploy this today?
```

> Checklist exists. AI ignores half of it.

#### `.n2` Contract

```n2
@workflow PostCodingVerify {
  description: "Automated post-coding verification"
  trigger: on_event(n2_coding_verify)
  enforce: strict

  step check_temp_files {
    action: scan_for(patterns: [/\.tmp$/, /\.bak$/, /scratch/])
    expect { none_found => continue }
  }

  step check_unused_imports {
    action: lint_check(rule: "no-unused-imports")
    expect { pass => continue }
  }

  step check_console_log {
    action: scan_for(patterns: [/console\.log/])
    expect { none_found => continue }
  }

  step type_check {
    action: run_command("tsc --noEmit")
    expect {
      exit_code == 0 => continue
      fail => abort with "TypeScript errors must be fixed before completion"
    }
  }

  step senior_review {
    depends_on: [check_temp_files, check_unused_imports, check_console_log, type_check]
    action: self_review(question: "Would you be proud to deploy this today?")
    required: true
  }
}
```

> Every step must pass. Failure blocks completion. No shortcuts.

---

### 4. Configuration

#### `.md` Skill

```markdown
## Rules
- Max file lines: 500
- Max function lines: 50
- Use TypeScript strict mode
```

> Hardcoded values buried in prose. No way to override per-project.

#### `.n2` Contract

```n2
@schema CodingConfig {
  max_file_lines: int [default: 500]
  max_function_lines: int [default: 50]
  max_complexity: int [default: 10]
  strict_mode: bool [default: true]
  allowed_languages: string[] [default: ["typescript", "python", "rust"]]
}
```

> Type-checked, defaulted, overridable. Import and customize per-project:

```n2
@import { CodingConfig } from "n2-coding.n2"

# Override for this specific project
@meta {
  config: CodingConfig {
    max_file_lines: 300    # Stricter for this project
    allowed_languages: ["typescript"]
  }
}
```

---

### 5. Querying & Debugging

#### `.md` Skill

```
How to find which rules apply?  → Ctrl+F through the document
How to check if rules conflict? → Read everything manually
How to audit what's enforced?   → You can't
```

#### `.n2` Contract

```bash
# List all strict rules
$ n2c query coding.n2 "SELECT name, scope FROM rules WHERE enforce = 'strict'"

┌──────────────────────┬───────┬─────────┐
│ name                 │ scope │ enforce │
├──────────────────────┼───────┼─────────┤
│ TypeSafety           │ code  │ strict  │
│ Complexity           │ code  │ strict  │
│ NamingConventions    │ code  │ strict  │
│ Security             │ code  │ strict  │
└──────────────────────┴───────┴─────────┘

# Validate all contracts for integrity
$ n2c validate coding.n2

✅ State machine: CodingLifecycle — 5 transitions, integrity verified
✅ All rules: 4 rules, 0 errors, 0 warnings
✅ Workflow: PostCodingVerify — 5 steps, dependency chain valid
```

## Summary

| Aspect | `.md` Skill | `.n2` Contract |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Format** | Free-form prose | Structured blocks |
| **Parsing** | AI "reads" it | PEG grammar → AST |
| **Enforcement** | 🙏 Hope | ❌ Compiler-blocked |
| **Workflow order** | Numbered list | State machine transitions |
| **Configuration** | Hardcoded in text | Schema with types + defaults |
| **Querying** | Ctrl+F | SQL queries |
| **Debugging** | Read everything | `n2c validate` pinpoints errors |
| **Cross-project** | Copy-paste | `@import` from shared files |
| **Versioning** | Manual | `@meta { version: "1.0.0" }` |
| **Determinism** | Different every run | Same input → same plan |

## Real-World Impact

In our own N2 ecosystem, switching from `.md` skills to `.n2` contracts eliminated:

- ❌ AI skipping boot sequence → **state machine blocks it**
- ❌ AI using `as any` → **TypeSafety rule blocks it**
- ❌ AI ending work without verification → **CodingLifecycle invariant blocks it**
- ❌ AI running destructive commands → **Ark security gate blocks it**
- ❌ Multiple agents editing same file → **ownership contract blocks it**

> *"The difference between `.md` and `.n2` is the difference between asking nicely and having a compiler."*
